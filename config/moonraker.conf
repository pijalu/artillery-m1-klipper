[file_manager]
queue_gcode_uploads: False
#   When set to True the file manager will add uploads to the job_queue when
#   the `start_print` flag has been set.  The default if False.
check_klipper_config_path: False
#   By default Moonraker will validate that Klipper's configuration file exists
#   within the data path's "config" folder, as this is a requirement for
#   Moonraker to write to the configuration.  If this validation check fails
#   Moonraker will warn the user. Installations that do not wish to use Moonraker
#   to manage Klipper's configuration may set this option to False to bypass the
#   location check.  The default is True.
enable_object_processing: False
#   When set to True gcode files will be run through a "preprocessor"
#   during metadata extraction if object tags are detected.  This preprocessor
#   replaces object tags with G-Code commands compatible with Klipper's
#   "cancel object" functionality.  Note that this process is file I/O intensive,
#   it is not recommended for usage on low resource SBCs such as a Pi Zero.
#   The default is False.
file_system_observer: inotify
#   The observer used to monitor file system changes.  May be inotify or none.
#   When set to none file system observation is disabled.  The default is
#   inotify.
enable_observer_warnings: False
#   When set to True Moonraker will generate warnings when an observer
#   encounters an error. This may be useful to determine if the observer
#   malfunctioning. The default is True.

[webcam m1pro_webcam]
location: printer
#   A description of the webcam location, ie: what the webcam is observing.

# icon:
#   A name of the icon to use for the camera.  See the tip following this
#   example for known values.  The default is mdiWebcam.
enabled: True
#   An optional boolean value to indicate if this webcam should be enabled.
#   Default is True.
service: mjpegstreamer-adaptive
#   The name of the application or service hosting the webcam stream.  Front-

snapshot_url:/webcam/?action=snapshot
#   The url for the camera snapshot request.  This may be a full url or a
#   relative path (ie: /webcam?action=stream) if the stream is served on the
#   same host as Moonraker at port 80.  The default is an empty url.
flip_horizontal: False
#   A boolean value indicating whether the stream should be flipped
#   horizontally.  The default is false.
flip_vertical: False
#   A boolean value indicating whether the stream should be flipped
#   vertically.  The default is false.

# aspect_ratio: 4:3
#   The aspect ratio to display for the camera.  Note that this option
#   is specific to certain services, otherwise it is ignored.
#   The default is 4:3.
